## BlueDash
### Dual-Screen BlueAlliance Web Dashboard to use on displays in front of FRC pits.

**Note:** *BlueDash is currently in alpha, and may not work as expected.* 

### The Basics
BlueDash is a web dashboard designed to pull data from BlueAlliance and show it in front of your FRC team's pit. It requires you to input an API key upon opening, and will remember it if you have cookies enabled. It is currently in alpha and will not work 100% as I, the developer, am currently learning better web standards and frameworks.
